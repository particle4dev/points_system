-- LIQUINA Partner Points Boost Scenario (With Traceability) --
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
This script simulates a partner campaign where eligible users receive a weekly
boost. Crucially, this version separates the "boost" points into their own
dedicated campaign for clear traceability, so the user can see exactly why
they received bonus points.

Scenario Simulated:
1.  SETUP:
    - TWO campaigns are created:
        1. "Harmonix Main Season 1": For all base points from regular activity.
        2. "LIQUINA Weekly Boost": A dedicated campaign to hold only the bonus
           points awarded from this partner initiative.
    - Historical user activity is pre-populated for the main campaign.

2.  BOOST CALCULATION & DISTRIBUTION:
    - The script calculates the weekly earnings from the "Harmonix Main Season 1"
      campaign history.
    - It then calculates the bonus amount.
    - Instead of adding the bonus to the main campaign, it AWARDS the points to
      the dedicated "LIQUINA Weekly Boost" campaign. This creates a separate
      `PointsUserCampaignPoints` record for the user.

3.  VERIFICATION & DISPLAY:
    - The user's total points (`PointsUserPoint`) are still aggregated correctly
      by the database trigger.
    - The `PointsUserPointHistory` now contains entries from BOTH campaigns.
    - The verification output has been enhanced to show the source campaign for
      each point transaction, proving that the system can tell a user:
      "You earned +1000 from 'Main Season 1' and +200 from 'LIQUINA Boost'".
