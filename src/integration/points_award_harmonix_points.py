"""
Usecase Description:
This script simulates a common business scenario where a partner (Harmonix)
organizes a points campaign. After the event concludes, an administrative
process runs to award points to a participating user.

The script demonstrates the entire flow:
1. It programmatically creates a new, temporary campaign for Harmonix.
2. It then grants points to a new user for their participation in that campaign.
3. Finally, it queries the database to verify that the automated triggers have
   correctly:
   - Logged the transaction in the `PointsUserPointHistory` table.
   - Updated the user's total balance in the `PointsUserPoint` summary table.

The entire operation is wrapped in a transaction that is rolled back at the end,
ensuring that running this test script does not permanently alter the database.
